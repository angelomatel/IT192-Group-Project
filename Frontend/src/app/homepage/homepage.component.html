            <p>Our shelter has amassed a total of 100 animals of different kinds and are in need of loving parents. These animals
              have experience pain, hardships, and emotional stress. They deserve all the love and care that they need. That is what
              our shelter is trying to find and provide for them. The rightful place with the rightful owners.
